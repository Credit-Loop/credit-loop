I'd like to build a blockchain based system, which is based on erc 2535 diamond pattern/architecture. 

the core of the idea, is creating debt chains that removes the need for trust. See image and write me a brief how this can be handled. Eg. We'll have a mechanism, where if X owes to Y and Y owes to Z, somehow Z would track of who owes to Y, and would request Y to channel/pipe the debt of X to himself. So that, he would not depend on Y's honesty etc. on paying to Z whenever collect their debt from X. 

Write me a brief, then a development plan in a stable coin. Eg. xdai, but we'll create smart contracts in solidity.

Brief: Blockchain-Based Debt Chain System

The goal of the debt chain system is to eliminate the need for trust by using blockchain to manage and automate the flow of debts across multiple parties. The system will:

    Track Debts and Dependencies: Use smart contracts to maintain a transparent and immutable record of who owes whom (e.g., Alice owes Bob, and Bob owes Susan).

    Chain Debt Transfers: Implement mechanisms to resolve multi-party debt chains. For instance:
        If X owes Y and Y owes Z, the system enables Z to claim the debt directly from X by "channeling" through Y.
        Z does not need to rely on Y to honestly forward funds.

    Stablecoin Integration: Use a stablecoin (e.g., xDai or USDC) to ensure consistent value transfer across transactions.

    ERC-2535 Diamond Architecture: Employ this modular smart contract architecture to maintain scalability and flexibility for the debt chain system.

    Automation & Security: Automate debt resolutions and transfers through event-driven mechanisms in Solidity, ensuring minimal human intervention and maximum security.

Development Plan
Phase 1: System Design and Architecture

    Debt Chain Model:
        Define entities: Debtor, Creditor, and Debt Chain Participant.
        Specify debt attributes: amount, creditor, debtor, status (active/resolved).

    Smart Contract Modules:
        Debt Management: Create, view, and settle debts.
        Chain Resolution: Automate multi-party debt resolution.
        Payment Processing: Facilitate payments using a stablecoin.

    ERC-2535 Setup:
        Define facets for core functionalities (e.g., DebtFacet, PaymentFacet, ResolutionFacet).
        Create a diamond proxy contract for managing facets.

Phase 2: Smart Contract Development

why do you think 

Implement escrow-like functionality to lock funds until debt resolution.

this is necessary? as chain grows, the proxy contract will channel the funds to the final creditor, and none of the intermediaries will do nothing, but only will see that their debts collected (partially or fully). So, by referencing the bilateral debt-credit contracts, we'll update the debt amounts (as paid) and statuses ( when fully paid.)

You're absolutely correct! In the architecture you're describing, an escrow-like functionality is unnecessary because the proxy contract acts as the central mechanism for automating and channeling payments directly between the ultimate debtor and creditor. The bilateral debt-credit relationships ensure:

    Debt Propagation: The smart contract propagates payments through the chain without relying on intermediaries.
    State Updates: The debt statuses (partial/fully paid) and amounts are updated by referencing the bilateral contracts.
    Trustless Execution: Intermediaries do not need to take any action or hold funds; the smart contract automatically handles everything.

By removing escrow, the system:

    Avoids additional complexity and gas costs.
    Streamlines payment processing directly from debtor to creditor.
    Keeps the focus on the chain mechanism to resolve debts dynamically.

Revised Development Plan Highlights:

    Debt Propagation Logic:
        Smart contracts reference bilateral agreements.
        Payment flow triggers updates in all affected contracts.

    State Updates:
        Automatically mark debts as paid (partially/fully) when funds transfer through the chain.
        Maintain event logs for transparency.

    Direct Payments:
        Payments flow directly to the final creditor.
        Intermediaries' roles are passive, only observing debt resolution updates.

The overall system becomes leaner and more efficient without escrow, relying entirely on automated logic for trustless chain resolution.

Debt Chain System: A Trustless Blockchain-Based Solution
Overview

The Debt Chain system automates and simplifies debt settlement across multiple parties using smart contracts and blockchain. By leveraging the ERC-2535 Diamond architecture, it ensures scalability, modularity, and trustless execution. The system eliminates the need for intermediaries to take manual action by automating payments and updates directly between debtors and creditors.
Core Idea

    If Alice owes Bob and Bob owes Susan, the system enables Susan to directly claim Alice's payment through a debt chain.
    Payments are routed to the final creditor (Susan), and all intermediariesâ€™ debt-credit contracts are automatically updated to reflect partial or full settlements.
    Intermediaries are passive participants, observing status updates in their contracts without handling funds directly.

Development Plan
Phase 1: System Design

    Debt Chain Structure:
        Define a bilateral debt-credit contract model where:
            Each debt has a debtor, creditor, amount, and status (active/partial/fully paid).
        Include an event-driven system to notify all affected parties of updates.

    Core Components:
        Debt Management:
            Register new debts with the system.
            Update debt amounts and statuses automatically upon payment.
        Debt Chain Resolution:
            Enable creditors to trace and claim payments through the debt chain.
        Payment Routing:
            Facilitate direct payments from debtor to final creditor while updating all intermediate contracts.

    ERC-2535 Diamond Architecture:
        Use facets for modular functionality:
            DebtFacet: For creating and managing debts.
            ResolutionFacet: For resolving multi-party debt chains.
            PaymentFacet: For routing payments and updating states.

Phase 2: Smart Contract Development

    Bilateral Debt Contracts:
        Deploy contracts to track each bilateral relationship with the following:
            debtor: The person who owes.
            creditor: The person owed.
            amount: The outstanding balance.
            status: Current state of the debt.
        Implement events for DebtUpdated and DebtPaid.

    Debt Resolution Mechanism:
        Write a function to trace chains dynamically:
            Start with the final creditor.
            Trace backward through debt-credit relationships to aggregate the total amount owed.
        Automate payments from the initial debtor to the final creditor, bypassing intermediaries.

    Direct Payment Processing:
        Use stablecoins (e.g., xDai, USDC) for payments.
        Implement smart contracts that:
            Channel payments directly to the final creditor.
            Update all intermediaries' debts simultaneously (partial or full payment).
        Remove the need for escrow by ensuring atomic operations for payment routing and status updates.

    Security Features:
        Prevent circular dependencies by validating debt chains before creating or resolving them.
        Add signature-based authorizations for debt creation and updates.

Phase 3: Testing and Deployment

    Testnet Deployment:
        Deploy the system on a blockchain testnet (e.g., Gnosis Testnet or Ethereum Goerli).
        Verify the functionality of individual modules:
            Create and resolve debts.
            Handle multi-party debt chains.

    Unit Testing:
        Test for edge cases:
            Partial payments.
            Circular chains.
            Multi-party debt resolutions.

    Integration Testing:
        Simulate real-world scenarios with multiple debtors and creditors.
        Verify gas efficiency and state updates across the chain.

Phase 4: Frontend Development

    User Interface:
        Build a DApp with the following features:
            Create and manage debts.
            View debt chains and their statuses.
            Initiate payments and observe real-time updates.

    Debt Chain Visualization:
        Provide a graphical representation of chains showing relationships, amounts, and statuses.

    Wallet Integration:
        Allow users to connect wallets for seamless interaction and payment initiation.

Phase 5: Mainnet Deployment

    Deploy on Mainnet:
        Use Gnosis Chain (xDai) or Ethereum for stablecoin-based transactions.
        Ensure the system is optimized for low gas costs.

    Monitoring and Scaling:
        Implement on-chain analytics to monitor usage and identify bottlenecks.
        Scale the system to support more users and complex chains.

Technical Implementation Highlights

    Debt Creation:

function createDebt(address debtor, address creditor, uint256 amount) external {
    // Validate input
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than zero");
    // Record debt
    debts[debtor][creditor] = Debt(amount, Status.Active);
    emit DebtCreated(debtor, creditor, amount);
}

Debt Resolution:

function resolveDebtChain(address finalCreditor) external {
    // Trace chain and aggregate amounts
    uint256 totalOwed = traceChain(finalCreditor);
    // Route payment
    transferStablecoin(msg.sender, finalCreditor, totalOwed);
    // Update intermediary debts
    updateChainStatus(finalCreditor, totalOwed);
}

Payment Processing:

    function transferStablecoin(address from, address to, uint256 amount) private {
        // Transfer stablecoin
        IERC20(stablecoin).transferFrom(from, to, amount);
    }

Advantages of the System

    Trustless Execution: No reliance on intermediariesâ€™ honesty; payments are automated and direct.
    Transparency: All transactions and updates are recorded immutably on-chain.
    Scalability: Modular design via ERC-2535 allows easy addition of features.

This approach ensures efficient debt management and seamless resolution, leveraging blockchain's inherent trustless and transparent nature.
